                <p>
                    Sweden is a country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the 'Öresund'. 
                    At 450,295 square kilometers, Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of about 10,6 million. 
                    Sweden has a low population density of 23,7 inhabitants per square kilometer, but with a considerably higher density in the southern half of the country. 
                    Approximately 85% of the population live in urban areas.

                Sweden has a population of about 10.5 million people, with most living in urban areas, especially around Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. 
                The country has a high life expectancy, around 83 years, and a low birth rate. Immigration has played a major role in Sweden's population growth, 
                with people from Syria, Iraq, Finland, and other countries contributing to its diversity. This can be seen in the picture above mainly by the male surplus throughout all ages up until circa 60 years of age. Ethnic Swedes make up the majority, but Sweden is increasingly multicultural. 
                The population is aging, leading to economic and social challenges. Sweden's official language is Swedish, but English is widely spoken, along with many immigrant languages.

        <p Class="under">
            Sweden's population is relatively evenly distributed across its southern and central regions, with the north being sparsely populated due to its colder climate and vast forests. 
            The country has a population density of around 25 people per square kilometer, making it one of the least densely populated nations in Europe. The largest cities are Stockholm, 
            the capital, with around 1 million residents in the city proper, followed by Gothenburg and Malmö. Despite its low birth rate, Sweden has maintained steady population growth 
            primarily due to immigration. In recent years, migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe have contributed to the country's demographic shifts. 
            Sweden is known for its progressive social policies, and its welfare system supports a high quality of life for residents. The aging population presents challenges for 
            pensions and healthcare services, as the number of elderly people increases while the working-age population grows more slowly. Religious affiliation in Sweden is low, with 
            a majority identifying as secular, although historically, the Lutheran Church of Sweden has played a significant role. Additionally, cultural diversity has led to an increase 
            in the presence of Islam, Catholicism, and Orthodox Christianity.
