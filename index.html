    <p>Down below is a video of how the Pac-Man ghost's pathfinding works, 
       how they calculate the path to chase pacman with along with how the game works in general. 
       I've found it very useful when coding my pacman copy, so I thought I'd share it.

    <p>Pac-Man is a fun game because of many reasons, I have listed some here:
        <ol>
            <li>It's retro</li>
            <li>It's a classic</li>
            <li>The ghosts are cute</li>
            <li>The ghosts have mames! (The orange one is called Clyde :P)</li>
            <li>You recognize the intro music</li>
        </ol>
        I mean, just listen to this intro, it's perfect!

    <p>Pac-Man was created by the Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani.
